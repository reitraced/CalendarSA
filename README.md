# CalendarSA
A largely Garfield themed image of the day thing.

The actual important file is CalCommand.java which contains all the image selection code, and outputs the image as a FileInputStream.

just import that and use `CalCommand.gamer()` where you upload/process the image.

## Add your own images
To add an image simply add the file you want into `res/{1-7}/` with 1 corresponding to Monday

## Requirements
- Computer
- Java 8 or above (you better be using 8 or above dear god)
- Maven

Have fun i guess?
